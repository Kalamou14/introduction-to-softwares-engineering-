          <p> question1,).Yes inasmuch as any other engineering discipline relevant to the System of Interest is. Thus, if such a system has a software component that needs to be created, then Software Engineering will likely be a part of the overall design and development process. If the system is (say) mechanical, then likely not.
At the same time, Software Engineering is not integral to existing Systems Engineering processes. That said the objective managent.</p>
